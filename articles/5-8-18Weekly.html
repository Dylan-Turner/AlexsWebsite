            <h3 class="title is-4">The Big Dry - Drought in NSW and Queensland
            </h3>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h3 class="subtitle">By: Alexander W</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Summary: Farmers have been going through a bad drought for the past month in July.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>The almost customary Australian drought has hit us again. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Last month, while we were freezing our butts off in the ACT, much of Queensland experienced a <b>record-breakingly hot July</b>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          While it sounds pleasant from my perspective, the heat has caused a severe drought in Queensland and some of NSW. The intense heat has lead to the <b>evaporation of moisture in the soil</b>, meaning plants cannot grow.

        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Currently, many farmers are struggling to afford or even buy feed for their livestock, as hay is in short supply across the country.

        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          And in most cases, it seems like a lose-lose situation, as the hay used to feed livestock costs more than the <i>livestock is worth</i>.

        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          As well as the financial effects, droughts have great social costs for both children and adults.

        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          In an interview with the ABC, Manilla Central School principal Michael Windred said

        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          "There's the emotional drain on our students, it's the lack of sleep, it's the constant worry, it's got to have a bearing on their studying”

        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Many students in families affected by the drought are getting up at the break of dawn to give an extra helping hand on their farms.
        </p>
        <p>
          On the other hand, adults are feeling the stress of coping with dying livestock and an unstable future.

        </p>
        <p>
          Even in these tough times, Australians across the country have pitched in to help out, with many donations and aid program(such as <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-08-01/dresses-for-the-drought-provides-formal-outfits-affected-teens/10056480">this</a> creative initiative about donating formal dresses for drought-affected school students) being developed.

            <h3 class="title is-4">Benfold’s, the adopted, aborted, stepbrother of the Australian Penfold’s
            </h3>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h3 class="subtitle">By: Alexander W</h3>
        <p>Summary: A new online shopping company called Pinduoduo has been caught red-handed for selling, or at least facilitating the sale, of fake Australian wines.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>If our previous story made you thirsty, prepare to be <i>quenched</i>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>In the recent few years, Pinduoduo has risen to become one of the largest companies in China. It was recently admitted onto the Nasdaq (the American stock exchange) with a value of $USD 24 million.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Perhaps one could say that this has caused the Chinese giant to become <b>“drunk” with power</b> as they have recently been caught selling many fake products, including Australian wines.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="specialImg right">
          <a href="#">

          Photo: Benfold’s claims that it is a “legitimate” company and totally separate from Penfold’s.
          <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-08-04/benfords-anti-counterfeiting-advertisement/10070666">Source</a>
        </div>
        <p>Most notably, Penfold’s and Yellow Tail have had many rip-offs and fakes released. For Penfold’s, the Chinese rip-off <i>“Benfold’s”</i> and for Yellow Tail, it’s adopted Chinese sibling, <i>“Coastel Pearl”</i>. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>To most Australians and English speakers, they can be clearly distinguished from the original products, as the labels are often misspelt or use incorrect grammar.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>However, the rate at which these fakes are selling in China has major impacts on Australian wines.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>The ABC found that “One merchant on the platform alone had sold more than 1,000 six-bottle cases of their "Benford’s Hyland" wine at $117 a case”.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>This will directly result in fewer sales of legitimate Australian wines as well as the depreciation of our wine’s reputation - <i>excluding goon of course, as goon doesn’t have a good reputation in the first place</i>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>The economic and political implications of these wine fakes could worsen an already shaky relationship with China.

            <h3 class="title is-4">Values of Taxi Licenses Continue to Fall</h3>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h3 class="subtitle">By: Zack N</h3>
        <p>Summary: As the popularity of ride sharing grows, the Taxi industry is dying out, destroying people’s livelihoods.
        </p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Next time you catch an Uber, think about this.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>A Taxi licence in New York used to cost over $1 million. Now they can be bought for less than $150,000.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p><b>The purpose of these licenses was to limit the number of Taxis on the road.</b> This would push up fares and ensure that drivers were able to earn a living, rather than being forced to drive and earn barely enough to live.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>As ride sharing services such as Uber and Lyft grow in popularity, many <b>drivers turn to these companies because of the cheaper upfront cost and greater number of customers,</b>, however, they end up paying the price in the long run because of <b>systems that these companies use to avoid paying even minimum wages</b> (if your interested in this, check out the second on our list of sources).
      </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
      This doesn’t only have an economic effect, <b>six New York city drivers have committed suicide since last December.</b>
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
      Additionally, people have invested in these licences as a means of securing retirement funds, <b>only to find out that they can’t even sell them for a fraction of the price they bought them for.</b>
    </p> 
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>This problem exists in Australia too, and is a real problem for politicians trying to regulate the situation. They have to try and <b>balance between allowing Uber to operate and provide convenience for citizens, while compensating people involved in the taxi industry.</b>
    </p>
    <br/>
    <br/>
    <p>
      The Victorian Labour government has <b>given out $500 million to people affected by the change</b> while the liberals say they would give more if they were in power. The question is, <i>is this enough?</i>
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
      We’ll let you decide next time you need to get from A to B.
