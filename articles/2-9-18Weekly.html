        <p> Summary: I talk about some of the implications of the leadership spill.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Well readers, all has been said and done and we have been left with a <b>new Government. Scott Morrison is our Prime Minister</b>, and a few changes have been made to the <b>Cabinet</b> (which you can read about <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-08-26/scott-morrison-new-frontbench-who-is-in-and-who-is-out/10166554?section=politics"> here</a>).
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          We have a few newcomers to the Cabinet, such as <b>Melissa Price</b> and <b>Karen Andrews</b>, who have jumped into the spotlight after the leadership spill. No doubt that they were promised something by Scott Morrison for their political support.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Interestingly, Peter Dutton remains in the Cabinet, as the <b>Minister for Home Affairs</b> (minus Immigration). Scott Morrison seems to be trying to <b>rebuild the Liberal Party</b> team after this damaging spill.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          At the end of the day, I think that this spill has been extremely unproductive and almost <i>offensive</i> considering the political context.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          While NSW was in a <b>drought crisis</b> and important international decisions - such as the Indonesian trade talks - were to be made, <b>our politicians were bickering</b> in a power struggle.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          If our Government isn’t there for us in times of need, <i>what’s their point</i>? This has already happened many times now. Perhaps it is time to <b>implement party</b> rules similar to the ones described by Kevin Rudd.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Ok. It’s easy to criticize but what are the actual <i>benefits</i> of this reshuffle? To my mind, they are few and far between.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          I can concede that perhaps the old Coalition <b>wasn’t representing the views of the conservative</b> Ministers and their constituents. If this was the case, then changes must be made <b>to ensure proper representation</b>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          However, the new Cabinet does not seem to be <b>any more conservative than the previous</b>, with many previous Ministers retaining their roles.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          And maybe, we’ll have <b>another reshuffle</b> again soon if the Coalition loses the election.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Then again, if this can solve some of the issues within the Coalition and lead to a more cohesive Government then perhaps the lost time will be <b>worth it</b>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Let’s be honest, as seen in the polls (which <b>“showed Labor leading the coalition 56 per cent to the Government's 44 per cent on a two-party preferred basis.”</b> - ABC), unless something drastic happens, <b>Bill Shorten and the Labor Party</b> are going to take over anyway.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          And look, maybe that’s why we had this spill. To try and breathe a few gasps of life into a suffocation Government. After all, this recent incident has blasted <b>Scott Morrison into the media</b> and given him <b>more attention</b>, even more than everybody's <i>favourite</i> American President.

            <h3 class="title is-4">Trump Cancels Visit to Australia.
            </h3>
          </div>

        <h3 class="subtitle">By: Zack N</h3>
        <p> Summary: Donald Trump is now unlikely to visit Australia this year.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>Donald Trump had planned to visit the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation Summit </b> in Papua New Guinea later this year.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>He was also planning to visit Australia</b> after this summit. It would have been his first visit to Australia since becoming president and his first chance to meet our new prime minister.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Recently, news from the white house has showed that he is pulling out of the summit and <b>will instead send Mike Pence</b>, the vice president. He will be instead in France for the 100th anniversary of end of the First World War.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          This is a shame for Australia as <b>it would have been a good chance to reaffirm a relationship with a longstanding ally</b>. As we’ve seen, Donald Trump can be very unpredictable.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Scott Morrison spoke with Donald Trump on the phone last week and had what he called a “great discussion”.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          With his recent visit to Indonesia and his progress on an Indonesia-Australia free trade deal, <b>
          <i>ScoMo’s</i> international relationships are not looking too bad</b>, and this would only have added to that.
        </p>

            <h3 class="title is-4">Julie Bishop, WAsted.</h3>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h3 class="subtitle">By: Alexander W</h3>
        <p> Summary: Although Julie Bishop has probably lost the most from the last leadership spill, she has expressed determination in continuing her political career.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          The curious case of Julie Bishop can be compared to the tragedy of Julius Caesar. A popular and loved politician attempts to <b>elevate their career</b> and <b>gets backstabbed</b> by those whom they thought they could trust.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          In Caesar’s case, he tried to use his popularity amongst the common people to become <b>Emperor of Rome</b>. This lead to him being <b>murdered by other senators</b> and even those he trusted, as Shakespeare puts it; <i>“Et tu Brute?”</i>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="specialImg right">
          <a href="#">
            <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Vincenzo_Camuccini_-_La_morte_di_Cesare.jpg/400px-Vincenzo_Camuccini_-_La_morte_di_Cesare.jpg" alt="Kids..."></a>
          <p>
            <small>Photo: Ok, maybe it wasn't <i>this</i> dramatic. <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/e/eb/Vincenzo_Camuccini_-_La_morte_di_Cesare.jpg/400px-Vincenzo_Camuccini_-_La_morte_di_Cesare.jpg">Source</a>
            </small>
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          And at a glance, Julie Bishop seems similar. An influential and loved politician attempts to become <b>Prime Minister, only to be deserted</b> by all her fellow WA MPs in favour of ScoMo. Similar to Caesar’s death, it seemed like this was the <b>death of her career</b>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          However, “the Liberal's most popular federal member in WA” (Peter Kennedy) will run again in the next election for the electorate of Curtin (which she won by 70% last election).
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          And, more power to her! <b>Parliament needs more influential women</b> (and MP’s for that matter) just like her.
        </p>
