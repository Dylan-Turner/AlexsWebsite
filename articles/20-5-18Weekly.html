			    <p>
			    	Westpac recently had a survey amongst its’ customers about the recent budget. (Which you can look at our coverage <a href="">here</a>, <small class="is-small">not a shameless plug.</small>) 
			    	<br/>
			    	<br/>

			    	In general, the budget was well received by Westpac's customers.
			    </p>
			    <br/>
			    <p> 
			    	The main reason why customers like the new budget is because of the lower taxes that come with it, and fairly so. The government is pushing to give “the people their money back”.
			    	<br/>
			    	<br/>
			    	But it doesn’t come with it’s fair share of doubts.
				</p>
				<br/>
				<p> 
			    	Westpac customers are concerned about rising petrol prices and lower houses prices. Along with slow wage growth, Kate Hickey, an economic analyst, predicts that consumption rates will slow down to “about 2% by the end of this year.”

		          </div>
		        </div>
			  
			  <p> 
			  	<br/>
			  	Summary: China doesn’t consider the relationship worth it anymore.<br/><br/>
			  </p>
			  <br/>
			  <p>
		  		It comes after the former Australian ambassador to China, Geoff Raby, has demanded for Julie Bishop to be sacked for pretty much screwing up Australia’s relationship with China.
			  </p>
			  <br/>
			  <p>
		  		For context, Julie has criticized the Chinese government quite a few times, which has angered the Chinese government.
			  </p>
			  <br/>
			  <p>
		  		Bishop replied by essentially saying “well you don’t really know what goes on behind the scenes”.
			  </p>
			  <br/>
			  <p>
		  		And she’s right, in a way. Raby doesn’t know, but no one else seems to know either, including Julie Bishop herself. She even called the Australia-China relationship
			  </p>
			  <br/>
			  <h5 class="title is-5">“Deep and strong”</h5>
			  <p>
		  		Which is all well and good until you realise a branch of the Chinese government-run newspaper said this a few days ago:
			  </p>
			  <br/>
			  <h5 class="title is-5">“The China-Australia relationship doesn't carry much weight in Beijing diplomacy”</h5>
			  <p>
		  		So much for that. One of worst break-ups in the history of Australia for sure, as China is Australia’s leading trade partner.
			  </p>

			  	Summary: Experts say there is a risk that Netflix will not produce many shows in Australia.
			  </p>
			  <br/>
			  <p>
			  	With more and more Netflix Originals coming out, as well as other on-demand services, such as Hulu and Amazon Prime, experts say that Australia may miss out on a growing film industry.
			  </p>
			  <br/>
			  <p>
			  	With producing in Australia being costly, it is easy to see why only a few shows and movies have come out in the past few years.

		          </div>
		        </div>
			  
			  <p> 
			  	Summary: Some MP’s are cut from being cut from running as a candidate for the next election, whenever that is.
			  </p>
			  	<br/>
			  <p>
			  	To catch everyone up, it is widely speculated that Malcolm Turnbull will call a Double Dissolution Election, so all the political parties have been running local ‘preselections’, to determine who will run in this upcoming election.
			  </p>
			  <br/>
			  <p>
			  	Now, you may be asking yourself at this point, what on earth is a double dissolution senate election?
			 </p>
			 <br/>
			 <p>Good question for Google.</p>
			 <br/>
			 <p><i>“When both houses of Parliament are ‘dissolved’ and every seat is re-elected.”</i></p>
			 <br/>
			 <p>Last Sunday, it was announced that Liberal MP Jane Prentice had been beaten in the preselection, and now Liberal MP Ann Sudmalis is also being challenged at her preselection.</p>
			 <br/>
			 <p>It’s a common pattern in Liberal preselections. Many female MPs have been challenged, and a few other Liberal MP’s have even threatened to leave the party if more women are cut. </p>
			 <br/>
			 <p>This comes at a time where there is more and more pressure on both major political parties to have proper female representation. The Labour party has a quota for the number of female MP’s, however, the Liberal Party is yet to introduce a policy like this.</p>
