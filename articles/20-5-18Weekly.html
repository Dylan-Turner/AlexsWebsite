	          <p>Summary: Westpac customers think that the tax cuts are good, but they might not be good enough.
	            <br>
	          </p>
	          <br>
	          <p> Westpac recently had a survey amongst its’ customers about the recent budget. (Which you can look at our coverage <a href="https://uninformedreader.com/articles/budgetSpecial.html">here</a>, not a shameless plug.)
	            <br>
	            <br>
	          </p>
	          <p> In general, the budget was well received by Westpac's customers.
	            <br>
	            <br>
	          </p>
	          <p> The main reason why customers like the new budget is because of the lower taxes that come with it, and fairly so. The government is pushing to give “the people their money back”.
	            <br>
	            <br>
	          </p>
	          <p> But it doesn’t come with it’s fair share of doubts.
	            <br>
	            <br>
	          </p>
	          <p> Westpac customers are concerned about rising petrol prices and lower houses prices. Along with slow wage growth, Kate Hickey, an economic analyst, predicts that consumption rates will slow down to “about 2% by the end of this year.”

	          Summary: China doesn’t consider the relationship worth it anymore.<br>
	          <br>
	        </p>
	        <div>
	          <p> Major diplomatic beef between China and Australia has arisen this week.
	            <br>
	            <br>
	          </p>
	          <p> It comes after the former Australian ambassador to China, Geoff Raby, has demanded for Julie Bishop to be sacked for pretty much screwing up Australia’s relationship with China.
	            <br>
	            <br>
	          </p>
	          <p> For context, Bishop has criticized the Chinese government quite a few times, which has angered the Chinese government.
	            <br>
	            <br>
	          </p>
	          <p> Bishop replied by essentially saying “well you don’t really know what goes on behind the scenes”.
	            <br>
	            <br>
	          </p>
	          <p> And she’s right, in a way. Raby doesn’t know, but no one else seems to know either, including Julie Bishop herself. She even called the Australia-China relationship:
	            <br>
	            <br>
	            <font><b>"Deep and strong"</b>
	            </font>
	            <br>
	            <br>
	          </p>
	          <p> Which is all well and good until you realise a branch of the Chinese government-run newspaper said this a few days ago:
	            <br>
	            <br><b>“The China-Australia relationship doesn't carry much weight in Beijing diplomacy”</b>
	            <br>
	            <br>
	          </p>
	          <p> So much for that. Looks to be one of worst break-ups in the history of Australia for sure, as China is Australia’s leading trade partner.

	          Summary: Experts say there is a risk that Netflix will not produce many shows in Australia.<br>
	          <br>
	        </p>
 	          <p> With more and more Netflix Originals coming out, as well as other on-demand services, such as Hulu and Amazon Prime, experts say that Australia may miss out on a growing film industry.

	          <p> As producing in Australia is costly, it is easy to see why only a few shows and movies have come out in the past few years.
	            <br>
	            <br>
	          </p>
	          <p> Let’s be honest, having shows and movies set in Australia or filmed in Australia might be nice, and the increase of jobs would be nice, but we don’t think it’s essential.

	          <b>Summary:</b> Some MP’s are cut from being cut from running as a candidate for the next election, whenever that is.<br>
	          <br>
	        </p>
	          <p> To catch everyone up, this year, as well as state elections for Tas, SA and Vic, Malcolm Turnbull will also be calling by-elections for a few senators and MPs who have either retired/resigned or been removed due the dual citizenship scandal.
	            <br>
	            <br>
	          </p>
	          <p>Basically, the dual-citizenship scandal involved senators and MPs being citizens of multiple countries. According to the constitution, you can only be an Australian citizen to run for Parliament, forcing many senators and MPs to resign.This means that “by-elections” have to be held for their seat again.
	            <br>
	            <br>
	          </p>
	          <p>So all the political parties have been running local ‘preselections’ for these areas as well as for the , to determine who will run in this upcoming election. 
	          </p>
	          <br/>
	          <br/>
	          <p>Last Sunday, it was announced that Liberal MP Jane Prentice had been beaten in the preselection, and now Liberal MP Ann Sudmalis is also being challenged at her preselection.
	            <br>
	            <br>
	          </p>
	          <p>It’s a common pattern in Liberal preselections. Many female MPs have been challenged, and a few other Liberal MP’s have even threatened to leave the party if more women are cut.
	            <br>
	            <br>
	          </p>
	          <p>This comes at a time where there is more and more pressure on both major political parties to have proper female representation. The Labour party has a quota for the number of female MP’s, however, the Liberal Party is yet to introduce a policy like this.
	            <br>
	            <br>

	              What do you think?
	              Should we have quotas to increase the number of women or just choose whoever stands out the most? Send your opinions to contact@uninformedreader.com.
