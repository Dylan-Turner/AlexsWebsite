          </div>
        </div>
        <h3 class="subtitle">By: Alexander W</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Summary: An ABC investigation into “WeChat” news sources has found that the clickbait and fake news trend is also common in Chinese news.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>The ABC investigation focussed on news outlets dedicated to Australian news for Chinese people living in Australia.</p>
        <br>
        <br>

        </div>
        <p>And, similar to the sensationalism and exaggeration of news in Western nations, these Chinese social media news sources aren’t much better.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>The ABC found articles with typical clickbait titles (translated obviously), such as;</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>“Breaking! ISIS officially announced their Australia attack!”
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>and
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>“Untold dark secret from 67 years ago.”
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>These titles actually look pretty similar to our titles sometimes.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Some of these stories, such as the latter, talk about supposedly secret nuclear testing areas in Australia which have radiated Australians and given them tumours and stuff.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>I don’t really even know what the article is talking about but I’m pretty sure that I haven’t been exposed to nuclear radiation (at least I hope).
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>This being said, many of the other articles simply have over-exaggerated or propaganda titles, which are pretty standard, especially in social media. And, many fake news articles, like the nuclear radiation one, have actually been removed by WeChat’s moderators due to being inaccurate.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>What do we think?
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>This isn’t anything out of the ordinary. Most <b>surviving</b> news sources use clickbait-y titles and borderline fake news articles in order to stay in business.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>And people love it! Social media news is quickly overtaking traditional news sources because it is can bring news faster than newspapers and also attract more people because of the accessibility and entertainment factor.

            <h3 class="title is-4">‘Values’ test for migrants</h3>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h3 class="subtitle">By: Zack N</h3>
        <p>Summary: Members of parliament are considering adding a test on “Australian values” for people seeking permanent residency in Australia.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Malcolm Turnbull spoke this week, saying Australia could potentially add an <b>extra test for people looking to migrate</b> to Australia.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>This ‘values’ test, as it is being referred to in the media, would aim to verify that immigrants are willing to uphold Australian values, such as <b>democracy, freedom, the rule of law, respect for women and equality between men and women.</b>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Ultimately, the purpose of this decision would be to promote a more <b>integrated</b> society and <s>stem the Asian invasion.</s>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Adding a values test would mean that migrants would hopefully enter and fit in with Australian culture, rather than creating their own separate groups within society.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
        Citizenship minister Alan Tudge says European countries are also heading in this direction.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
         Given that the immigration process <b>already requires that people sign a document saying they agree to Australian values</b>, we think it is completely reasonable that there should be a test put in place to confirm this. Otherwise, it is just a piece of paper with words on it...
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          However, <b>we need to be careful</b>, we wouldn’t want to require that migrants completely assimilate into our culture and leave their heritage behind. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
         As Race Discrimination Commissioner Tim Soutphommasane put it, ethnicity and lifestyle is completely different from values, we need to make sure we understand the difference:
</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
         “Anyone who comes here in a settles here and contributes to our society should not be expected to adhere to a particular lifestyle defined for example by the beach, sport and barbecues,” </p>
        <br>
        <br>
         <p>
         Editor’s note: I am slightly concerned with the effects that this will have on the migration of non-Western people to Australia. Of course, Australians should follow Australian laws, but this bill will lead to a clear yet subtle bias against values of other cultures and religions. 
</p>
        <br>
        <br>
         <p>
         For example, the Islamic values which encourage the use of burqas may be discouraged in Australia through this bill as men and women should be considered “equal” (which in itself is very broad). 
</p>
        <br>
        <br>
         <p>
         Thus, without further information about the specific questions and “values”, it is easy to see this law as somewhat racist and favouring immigrants from similar Western cultures.
</p>
        <br>
        <br>
         <p>
         This does not seem to be multicultural at all, it seems to be the subtle rebirth of a White Australia Policy.
</p>

            <h3 class="title is-4">Demonstrators of Gaza</h3>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h3 class="subtitle">By: Raf P</h3>
        <p>For the past 114 days the largest demonstration in decades has been waged by the people of Palestine along the Gaza Strip in protest of Israel’s borders.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
         Palestinian demonstrators have gathered at the fence, between Israel and Palestine, every week since March 30th. Currently there are 5000 protestors dispersed along the strip. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="specialImg left">
          <a href="#">
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/tJdC30b.jpg" alt="Kids..."></a>
          Photo: Fake news is entertaining, sorry Trump. <a href="http://www.voltairenet.org/local/cache-vignettes/L400xH250/arton198228-99c02.jpg">Source</a>
        </div>
        <p>
         The death toll has been estimated at around 140. It should be noted that Israeli snipers killed 60 demonstrators in one day on May 14, and around 16,000 have been injured. 

        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Even after 100 days of protesting and countless deaths, Israel’s stance on the supposed theft of Palestinian land has not wavered. In fact, they have justified their use of military action on protesters by claiming that they were defending their borders against aggressive advances by “Hamas insurgents”.

        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
         In truth, the vast majority of those killed and injured were civilian protesters who have been reported by numerous unbiased (well as unbiased as the media can get nowadays) sources to have been unarmed.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
         This continued false narrative from Israel must stop. Israel has clearly breached both international law as well as a few specific UN resolutions. 

        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          After over a hundred days of protest the Gaza Strip appears no closer to coming to an end.
