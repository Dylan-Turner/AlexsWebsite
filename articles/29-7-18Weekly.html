          <h3 class="title is-4">Playing with the Lions tail</h3>
        </div>
      </div>
      <h3 class="subtitle">By: Raf P</h3>
      <br>
      <p>Summary: Escalating tensions between Iran and the US have led to some interesting political discussion.</p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>The Iranian President Hassan Rouhani has warned President Trump to be ready for "the mother of all wars" if push comes to shove. </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <div class="specialImg left">
        <a href="#">
          <img src="https://i.imgur.com/vRWdOFY.jpg" alt="Kids..."></a>
        </div>
        <p>President Trump has responded in Trump fashion -- with several tweets warning of imminent destruction. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
        President Rouhani, in an address to Iranian diplomats, has said "Mr Trump, don't play with the lion's tail, it would only lead to regret".
      </p>
      <br>
      <br>
      <p>
      This comes after <b>increased tension between the two nations</b>, with the US placing sanctions and diplomatic pressure in the form of <b>withdrawing from the 2015 Nuclear deal</b>.
    </p>
    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
    Furthermore Rouhani has also said that "America should know that peace with Iran is the mother of all peace, and war with Iran is the mother of all wars," and made the positions of power quite clear "You are not in a position to incite the Iranian nation against Iran's security and interests."

    <br>
    <br>
    <p>
    Trump and his administration have latched on to this and fired back in the form of America's greatest ally, <b>Twitter</b>.
  </p>
  <br>
  <br>
  <p>
  As well as Trump's rhetoric, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo also responded in the form of a Press conference. In which, he called the government of Iran as “more of a Mafia than anything else” and said the country is gripped by vast wealth inequality and corruption.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
The picture that Pompeo is painting of Iran seems like a <i>self-portrait of Trump’s America more than anything</i>. Pompeo has also posted images and statements in an attempted smear of President Rouhani’s political campaign.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
It is important to note that this new controversy has almost <b>completely sidetracked the media from both Trump’s domestic failings</b> as well as the situation with Russia. Trump is using diplomatic fire and brimstone to play off the sensationalism of mainstream media outlets in order to mask his own numerous failings.

<h3 class="title is-4">“Super Saturday” not so super</h3>
</div>
</div>
<h3 class="subtitle">By: Alexander W</h3>
<p>Summary: Although the 28th of July marks the date of the by-election for 5 electorates, voters do not seem very interested.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>In what has been called “a crucial measure of support for the government” (ABC), the by-elections for Longman (QLD), Braddon (TAS), Mayo (SA), Perth (WA obviously) and Fremantle (WA) were held yesterday on “Super Saturday”.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>As a reminder, the four out of the five by-elections are due to <b>dual citizenship issues</b> with only Perth being due to a <b>resignation</b>.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Other than the electorate of Perth, the other electorates are being <b>re-contested by the previous members</b>. Outside of Mayo (which was held by Centre Alliance), the other electorates were all held by <b>Labor</b>.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Strategically, this result of these elections is quite important. </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>The coalition is running for three seats, Longman, Braddon and Mayo.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>If the Government picks up any more seats, they would <b>increase their majority</b> (which is currently only by one seat) and if they don’t they resume business as usual.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>But, both voters and Parliamentarians don’t seem to <i>care</i>.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>In the electorate of Longman where One Nation candidate Matthew Stephens is running, <b>Pauline Hanson didn’t even show up to express support</b>.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Instead, voters were told to take photos with some creepy cardboard cutouts of her. </p>

</div>
<br>
<br>
<p>As for Pauline, she is currently chilling on a luxury cruise somewhere near Great Britain.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>And as for Labor and Liberal?</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Labor seems to be doing alright, other than the general distrust and dislike for Bill Shorten after his backflip on the Company tax cut bill.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>The Liberals aren’t looking too great after being shut down at a meet and greet in Longman.</p>

</div>
<br>
<br>
<p>PM Malcolm Turnbull and LNP candidate Trevor Ruthenburg got verbally destroyed after local residents called them out for the <b>penalty rate cuts</b> and the <b>privatisation of the ABC</b>.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Overall, people seem to be sick of political bulls**t, like campaign promises. Instead, they’re mostly concerned about local and grassroots issues, like roads, schools and hospitals which they don’t think Federal Parliamentarians can help with.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>A line from the ABC sums it up perfectly:</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>“Voters aren't even angry, just contemptuous of politics in general, whoever it is they are talking about.” </p>
<br>
<br>
<p> *UPDATE (29.7.18)* Braddon, Longman, Fremantle and Perth have all been retained by Labor, Mayo was taken by the Centre Alliance. The parties that originally had the seats before the by-election have kept them. This is a big success for Labor, and bodes well for Labor’s chances at the Federal Election.

  <h3 class="title is-4">Indonesia Adopts Digital Voting</h3>
</div>
</div>
<h3 class="subtitle">By: Zack N</h3>
<p>Summary: Blockchain technology will allow greater voting transparency and security in an upcoming Indonesian election.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>This isn’t just the usual hype over a digital election that abruptly ends when Russia gets news of what’s happening.
<br>
<br>
</p>
<p>No, this is <b>blockchain</b>. Blockchain, if you haven’t heard of it, is the technology that underpins Bitcoin and many other digital currencies.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Blockchain technology will allow people to vote anonymously in a way that cannot be tampered with or changed by anyone. The way the technology achieves this is by <b>spreading the responsibility of keeping vote counts</b> across everyone instead of relying on some corrupt government to keep track.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
To give some perspective:
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
Imagine you are voting in a room with all the other voters. Every single person in the room has their own ballot box and everyone puts their vote into everyone else’s box. <b>It’s going to be very obvious</b> if someone tries to rig the voting system, because their box will be the only one that’s different.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
Right now, <b>this is just being trialed in a small part of Indonesia</b>, and the people are still understandably skeptical. The key will be to educate these people so that they trust the system.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
This technology presents exciting new opportunities for the integrity of voting in <b>emerging democracies</b> and we are looking forward to what this technology can lead to, especially in countries with higher rates of corruption. </p>
