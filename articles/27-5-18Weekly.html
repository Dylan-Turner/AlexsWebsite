	          <p>Summary: Apparently, some ‘anonymous’ Parliament House security officers leaked a security misconduct to <b><i>BUZZFEED</i></b> (of all places) and people are concerned.</p>
	          <br/>
	          <br>
	          <p>A senate hearing has been held to discuss the conduct of the Parliament House security in regards to a white powder being sent to Malcolm Turnbull about a month ago.
	          </p>

	          <br>
	          <br>

	          <p> Oddly, the incident was first reported on by Buzzfeed through anonymous security officers  and then later confirmed by the AFP.
	          </p>

	          <br>
	          <br>

	          <p> Although the powder was harmless, Buzzfeed reported that the security protocols were not up-to scratch.
	          </p>

	          <br>

	          </div>

	          <p> According to the <i>trustworthy</i> and very <i>reliable</i> news website, security officers testing the powder wore $6 Bunnings aprons and in previous cases, officers had resorted to tasting the powder to determine the safety.
	          </p>

	          <br>
	          <br>

	          <p> The fact that Buzzfeed is reporting on this stuff makes it seem like this is all an elaborate Buzzfeed prank [gone wrong] [got arrested].

	          </div>
	        </div>

	        <p>
	          Summary: Liberal MP, Andrew Hastie revealed in a <b>public</b> Parliament session that Dr. Chau Chak Wing allegedly co-conspired to bribe the President of the United Nations General Assembly.
	        </p>

	        <br/>
	        <br/>

          <p> Before we get into the story, it is important to say that Hastie had special Parliamentary rights when saying this. If a normal person were to say this in the media, they would be sued for defamation.
          </p>

          <br/>
	      <br/>

	          <p> Some context, Chau Chak Wing is a Chinese Australian who has allegedly donated <b>$4 MILLION</b> to both major political parties. Obviously, as an Australian citizen, this is perfectly legal if not a little bit over the top. 
	          </p>

 			<br/>
	      <br/>

	          <p> Last Tuesday, Andrew Hastie gave a speech about his recent intelligence meeting with the FBI. In the speech, he essentially revealed that in a recent law case involving the attempted bribery of the President of the UN General Assembly, one of the co-conspirators kept anonymous as CC-3 is actually Chau Chak Wing.
	          </p>

	           <br/>
	      <br/>

	          <p> Wow, <i>no one</i> would have expected that. Someone donating suspiciously large amounts to political parties is also trying to “donate” to other powerful figures.
	          </p>

	          <br>
	            <br>

	          <p>Hastie says that exposing this information is his <b>duty to Australia</b> which justifies his actions.
	          </p>

	          <br>
	            <br>

	          <p> Readers, what do you think, is Hastie abusing Parliamentary powers to defame and shame or do you think that Hastie had the nation’s best interests at heart?

 	          <p> With more and more Netflix Originals coming out, as well as other on-demand services, such as Hulu and Amazon Prime, experts say that Australia may miss out on a growing film industry.

	          <p> As producing in Australia is costly, it is easy to see why only a few shows and movies have come out in the past few years.
	            <br>
	            <br>
	          </p>
	          <p> Let’s be honest, having shows and movies set in Australia or filmed in Australia might be nice, and the increase of jobs would be nice, but we don’t think it’s essential.

	        <p>
	          <b>Summary:</b> Some MP’s are cut from being cut from running as a candidate for the next election, whenever that is.<br>
	          <br>
	        </p>

	          <p> To catch everyone up, this year, as well as state elections for Tas, SA and Vic, Malcolm Turnbull will also be calling by-elections for a few senators and MPs who have either retired/resigned or been removed due the dual citizenship scandal.
	            <br>
	            <br>
	          </p>
	          <p>Basically, the dual-citizenship scandal involved senators and MPs being citizens of multiple countries. According to the constitution, you can only be an Australian citizen to run for Parliament, forcing many senators and MPs to resign.This means that “by-elections” have to be held for their seat again.
	            <br>
	            <br>
	          </p>
	          <p>So all the political parties have been running local ‘preselections’ for these areas as well as for the , to determine who will run in this upcoming election. 
	          </p>
	          <br/>
	          <br/>
	          <p>Last Sunday, it was announced that Liberal MP Jane Prentice had been beaten in the preselection, and now Liberal MP Ann Sudmalis is also being challenged at her preselection.
	            <br>
	            <br>
	          </p>
	          <p>It’s a common pattern in Liberal preselections. Many female MPs have been challenged, and a few other Liberal MP’s have even threatened to leave the party if more women are cut.
	            <br>
	            <br>
	          </p>
	          <p>This comes at a time where there is more and more pressure on both major political parties to have proper female representation. The Labour party has a quota for the number of female MP’s, however, the Liberal Party is yet to introduce a policy like this.
	            <br>
	            <br>

	              What do you think?
	              Should we have quotas to increase the number of women or just choose whoever stands out the most? Send your opinions to contact@uninformedreader.com.
