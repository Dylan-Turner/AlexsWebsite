	          <p>Summary: Apparently, some ‘anonymous’ Parliament House security officers leaked a security misconduct to <b><i>BUZZFEED</i></b> (of all places) and people are concerned.</p>
	          <br/>
	          <br>
	          <p>A senate hearing has been held to discuss the conduct of the Parliament House security in regards to a white powder being sent to Malcolm Turnbull about a month ago.
	          </p>

	          <br>
	          <br>

	          <p> Oddly, the incident was first reported on by Buzzfeed through anonymous security officers  and then later confirmed by the AFP.
	          </p>

	          <br>
	          <br>

	          <p> Although the powder was harmless, Buzzfeed reported that the security protocols were not up-to scratch.
	          </p>

	          <br>
	          <br>

	          </div>

	          <p> According to the <i>trustworthy</i> and very <i>reliable</i> news website, security officers testing the powder wore $6 Bunnings aprons and in previous cases, officers had resorted to tasting the powder to determine the safety.
	          </p>

	          <br>
	          <br>

	          <p> The fact that Buzzfeed is reporting on this stuff makes it seem like this is all an elaborate Buzzfeed prank [gone wrong] [got arrested].

	            <h3 class="title is-4">MP exposes major Chinese “donor”</h3>
	          </div>
	        </div>

	        <p>
	          Summary: Liberal MP, Andrew Hastie revealed in a <b>public</b> Parliament session that Dr. Chau Chak Wing allegedly co-conspired to bribe the President of the United Nations General Assembly.
	        </p>

	        <br/>
	        <br/>

          <p> Before we get into the story, it is important to say that Hastie had special Parliamentary rights when saying this. If a normal person were to say this in the media, they would be sued for defamation.
          </p>

          <br/>
	      <br/>

	          <p> Some context, Chau Chak Wing is a Chinese Australian who has allegedly donated <b>$4 MILLION</b> to both major political parties. Obviously, as an Australian citizen, this is perfectly legal if not a little bit over the top. 
	          </p>

 			<br/>
	      <br/>

	          <p> Last Tuesday, Andrew Hastie gave a speech about his recent intelligence meeting with the FBI. In the speech, he essentially revealed that in a recent law case involving the attempted bribery of the President of the UN General Assembly, one of the co-conspirators kept anonymous as CC-3 is actually Chau Chak Wing.
	          </p>

	           <br/>
	      <br/>

	          <p> Wow, <i>no one</i> would have expected that. Someone donating suspiciously large amounts to political parties is also trying to “donate” to other powerful figures.
	          </p>

	          <br>
	            <br>

	          <p>Hastie says that exposing this information is his <b>duty to Australia</b> which justifies his actions.
	          </p>

	          <br>
	            <br>

	          <p> Readers, what do you think, is Hastie abusing Parliamentary powers to defame and shame or do you think that Hastie had the nation’s best interests at heart?

	        </div>
	        <p>
	          Summary: Turnbull’s pulled a fast one on the Labor Party by calling the by-elections for 5 electorates on the day of the ALP’s National Conference.
	        </p>
	        <div class="specialImg left">

	        <br>
	        <br>
 	          <p> He’s done it again. Turnbull got his political sniper, and pulled the trigger. Except this time, it’s on the Labor Party, not Tony Abbot.
	          </p>

	          <br>
	          <br>
	          
	          <p>He has called the by-elections for the electorates of Perth, Fremantle, Mayo, Longman and Braddon (the electorates where MPs resigned either due to personal reasons or dual citizenship) on the day of Labor’s national conference.
	          </p>

	          <br>
	          <br>

	          <p> This means that many of the top Labor party representatives will not be able to go to the convention to talk to their supporters but instead will have to go out to the election areas to support their candidates.
	          </p>

	          <br>
	          <br>

	          <p> As for the actual elections, Labor are almost certain to have Perth and Fremantle, as the Liberals are not running in those areas. 
	          </p>

	          <br>
	          <br>

	          <p> Braddon and Longman are in contention as the former Labor MPs who were disqualified due to dual citizenship are attempting to run again. In past, these seats were barely won by Labor so it may be a tough battle for them to win them again.

	          </p>

	          <br>
	          <br>

	           <p> Lastly, the electorate of Mayo is likely going to be won by the Liberals.</p>

	          <br>
	          <br>

	          <p> As a side note, Australia has some pretty weird electorate names. Mayo, Batman, Balaclava and Diamond Valley are some notable ones.</p>
