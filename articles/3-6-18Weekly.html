					</div>
				</div>
				<br>
				<p>Summary: One Nation Senator, Brian Burston, has decided to act independently of his party and Pauline Hanson is not happy. </p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p>Background info: Pauline Hanson and her “One Nation” Party is a far right wing party focussed around conservative ideas, such as immigration control and isolationism (being closed off from foreign companies and ideas).
				</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p> Last week, senator Brian Burston announced that he would vote to pass the government’s company tax cuts (basically the government wants to cut taxes for all companies by 25-30% by 2026), which were mentioned in the budget.
				</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p> This came after Pauline Hanson announced that the One Nation party would be voting to block the bill.

				</div>
				<p> Pauline Hanson has been left notably angry, even more angry than usual, which led to a hysterical walkout. You can check that out at the ABC News <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-05-31/one-nation-leader-splits-on-senator-during-media-address/9820760">website</a>.
				</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p> Hanson has called for Burston to resign from his position because she “no longer has confidence” in him. If Burston resigns, Hanson will be able to elect another One Nation party member to the Senate.
				</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p>
					Of course, Burston isn’t going to just roll over and resign. He has said that if he is sacked from the One Nation party, he will carry on as an independent.

					</div>
				</div>
				<p>
					Summary: Barnaby Joyce has announced that he will take a fortnight off as sick leave.
				</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p> Barnaby, who has recently divorced his wife of 24 years, has just welcomed his fifth child with his partner, Vikki Campion.
				</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p> Apparently, after a routine check-up, Barnaby Joyce has been authorised by his doctor to take a month off, however, he will only be taking a fortnight off.
				</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p> His Parliamentary colleagues are calling for the media to stop pursuing him as he gets his life back in order.

				</div>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p> However, this statement from his colleagues seems to contradict Barnaby’s $150,000 paid interview with 7 News that was teased last week.
				</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p>Imagine that, getting paid $150,000 for talking about how you screwed your assistant and left your wife and 4 children.
				</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p> Sounds pretty good to us.

						<h3 class="title is-4">Joke of the week: minimum wage increases will help millennials buy houses</h3>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>
					Summary: Minimum wage up 3.5% to $18.93, but unions wanted it to be 7.2%, so they aren’t that happy.
				</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p> Driven by unions, the Fair Work Commision (the people who have to deal with wages and workers in Australia) has increased the minimum wage by 3.5%, to $18.93 ($719.20 a week). Although good-looking on the surface, it is well below the 7.2% that unions were calling for.

				</div>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p>Wow.. 3.5%? How generous of the government. That means I can get a small house in the distant lands of Wagga Wagga in only 582 weeks! That’s like 11 years!
				</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p> Living on $719.20 a week isn’t glamorous to be sure. With housing prices increasing over the last few years, the only thing this wage increase will help with is getting some smashed avo on toast.
				</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p> It’s not even like a larger wage increase would take away from jobs and employers anyway.
				</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p>
					<a href="https://www.rba.gov.au/publications/rdp/2018/pdf/rdp2018-06.pdf">A Reserve Bank of Australia Study </a> found that there is “no evidence that these small, incremental increases in award wages” that unions are pushing for “have an adverse effect on hours worked or the job destruction rate.”
				</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p> The push for a higher minimum wage driven by unions will continue. The wage increase will be put into place on the 1st of July.</p>

						<h3 class="title is-4">Amazon blocking Australians from using international websites. Pesky regulations to blame.</h3>
					</div>
				</div>
				<p>
					Summary: Amazon to block Australian customers from using all international Amazon websites due to GDP laws.
				</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p> On July the 1st this year, a few new GDP regulations will be put into place, as a result of the budget. These regulations include forcing companies to pay GST on transactions internationally, making Amazon want to back out of Australia with their international stores.
				</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p> Previously, Amazon only had to pay GST if something bought overseas was $1000 or more, but that’s changing to 10% on everything bought on international sites shipped to Australia.
				</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p> A spokeswoman from Amazon said to the ABC that they had to “assess the workability” of Amazon with the new regulations, as a “global business with international sites” and they still couldn’t find an answer. Bummer.
				</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p> We still have Amazon Australia, but, at least in the short term, all international sites of Amazon are blocked. That really sucks because Amazon Australia isn’t that great to be honest.
				</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p> This came after a lot of anger from local retailers, such as JB Hi-Fi and David Jones about how unfair it was to compete for customers. After all, Amazon International is way cheaper than a typical retail store.
				</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p> Scott Morrison (Treasurer of Australia) said that this would “level the playing field” for Australian sellers. Basically, if Australian companies have to pay GST, so does Amazon and any other international sellers.
				</p>
				<br>
				<br>
				<p> Now where am I going to buy stuff? Outside?
