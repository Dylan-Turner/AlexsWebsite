        <p>Summary: Inside information from ex-One Nation Senator Brian Burston reveals that the inner workings of the One Nation party are quite similar to that of North Korea.

        <p>After a few weeks of public feuding, <b>Brian Burston has resigned from the One Nation Party</b>. This has left the Party with only 2 senators remaining, Pauline Hanson and Peter Georgiou.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>The One Nation party has essentially become powerless now as they only hold <b>two senate votes.</b>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> With his resignation, Brian Burston has <i>exposed some phat details</i> about the One Nation party through interviews. He called the One Nation party the <b>“Gone Nation”</b> and called Pauline Hanson an <b>autocratic leader</b> (basically a dictator like <i>Hitler</i> or <i>Kim</i>) who made all the party decisions.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
       
        <p>A <b>Supreme Leader</b> calling the shots, <b>political executions</b> of all that oppose them, including close friends, and a <b>loud mouth for a small amount of power</b>. This all sounds a lot like a <i>certain Asian dictatorship</i>.

            <h3 class="title is-4">Liberal Agendas</h3>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Summary: In the past week, the Liberal party have voted for a lot of things; the privatisation of the ABC, and moving an embassy to Jerusalem from Tel Aviv.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> 100 Liberal Party MP’s flocked to Sydney to attend the <b>annual Liberal Party federal council</b>, to discuss their plans for the year ahead. Specifically, at the event, they targeted <b>two issues </b>. The <b>privatisation of the ABC </b>, and the movement of the <b>Tel Aviv Australian Embassy to Jerusalem</b>. Let’s break these two down.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p><b>
          1. The Privatisation of the ABC
          </b>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> The Australian Broadcasting Commision (ABC) is currently funded by the government, although it received funding freezes in the most recent budget. The Liberal Party wants to <b>remove this funding entirely</b> and separate it from the government. This would make it a <b>private entity</b>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> This move would free up a <i>fair bit of money</i> for the government, but could possibly force the ABC to <b>cut some positions </b>or perhaps even become <b>slightly biased</b> due to a for-profit organisation funding it, just like we have seen in news sources in the USA (<i>Fox, CNN</i>, etc..
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p><b>2. The movement of the Australian embassy to Jerusalem</b>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> The Liberal Government wanted to also move the Australian Embassy that is in <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tel_Aviv">Tel Aviv</a> to Jerusalem. This comes after <b>Donald Trump moved the USA embassy to Jerusalem</b> in a highly controversial manner.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> Julie Bishop, the Foreign Minister for Australia, said that “Jerusalem is a final status issue” and that “[Australia] has maintained that position for decades.” Regardless, it <i>wasn’t passed</i> (43 votes to 37).
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> Although the Liberal Party voted for these changes, they aren’t binding to the government, so they probably aren’t going to affect the government’s current rules.

        <p>
          Summary: Donald Trump's media advisor fires blow at Canada, should Australia be worried?
        </p>
        <br>

          Photo: Trump with Canadian President, Justin Trudeau.
        </div>
        <p>Canadians and Americans have always had a special relationship with each other. Although, Canada and the USA are close allies and have worked together extensively, there always seem to bea bit of sibling rivalry, <b>especially with Trump in presidency</b>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>This week we were treated to another showing of the <i>Family Feud</i> with one of <b>President Trump’s media advisors</b> stating in an interview:
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>“There's a special place in hell for any foreign leader that engages in bad faith diplomacy with President Donald J. Trump and then tries to stab him in the back on the way out the door,".
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          This statement came after the <i>great diplomat himself</i> had spent time at the G7 Summit in Canada, just before going to Singapore to meet  Kim Jong Un.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          I think it is fair to say that the US leadership team’s reaction was <b>unwarranted and over the top</b>. This comes at a time where the North American Trade war is heightening and America’s alliances are being put under stress through the <i>unpredictable nature</i> of the Trump Government.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>Australia should be questioning our own alliance with the US</b> and prepare for the possibility that <b>we</b> could be the next target in Trump's diplomatic crusade. Perhaps we should consider creating <i><b>new, more reliable relationships</b>
          </i>
        </p>

            <h3 class="title is-4">Australian Military </h3>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          Summary: The Australian Military have been under fire this week after some pictures and stories have been brought to the media's attention.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> These files cover the misconduct of the Australian Army and it’s elite special forces unit the SASR. Chronologically, the first incident in is to do with images showing an Australian vehicle in Afghanistan in 2007.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="specialImg left">

          Photo: The photo in question. From <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/image/9859894-3x2-700x467.jpg">here.</a>
        </div>
        <p>The vehicle, containing Australian Army troops, was <b>flying a Nazi Germany swastika flag as it was driving</b>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          This has made international news, also receiving a comment from the PM who called the incident "disgraceful".
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> This embarrassing issue comes to light as other news comes out about the <b>alleged killings of several unarmed individuals in the Middle East</b>. One of which was supposedly a <b>rookie killing an unarmed amputee</b>, as part of a <b>‘bloodying’ initiation rite </b>which is supposedly based around soldiers killing someone to <i>‘get a feel for it’</i>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p><b>This second incident is simply disgusting.</b>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> These incidents are both under investigation from an external source, meaning that <i>this will not be the last we hear of</i> about the misconduct of the Australian Military. In the coming weeks, it is expected that many changes will be made in an attempt to <b>change the culture within the ranks of our military</b>.
