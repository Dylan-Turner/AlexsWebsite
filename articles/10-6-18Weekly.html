        <p>The famed ‘Poo Jogger’ has been plaguing the streets of downtown Brisbane for months, but this week has seen the unmasking of this urban legend.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> Residents installed security cameras to catch this Fecal Banksy and they had immediate success. The elusive is none other than the <b>national quality manager for Aveo</b> (a retirement village and investment company).
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>When this man isn’t donning the cape and going by the Poo Jogger, he goes by the name of Andrew Macintosh.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>This man was sh*tting on the lives of the elderly and now he is <b>literally sh*tting on their driveways</b>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> And Mr Macintosh is not the only one, he’s actions have spawned a trend. All across the globe men and women are taking to the streets and pooping while exercising. Most notably, a woman in Colorado has been caught doing a <b>poo in a supermarket</b> in the ice cream freezer. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Chocolate ice cream anyone?</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> Now this is where the story takes the <strike> poo </strike> piss. First our politicians have sexual intercourse with their staffers. Now we have well paid white men taking poos on the street. What’s next?
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Well here’s to hoping that our generation is remembered well by our predecessors, and forget about this absolute disaster of an incident.

          Summary: Royal Commission inquiry finds that banks really like money.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> For the past couple months, we have been treated to a Royal Commission on the banking sector of Australia. And what more have we learnt this week? Very little, for sure.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> We learnt that the banks need small business and small business need banks. (<a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-06-03/conflict-between-small-businesses-and-banks-exposed/9826360">ABC News</a>).
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> Well <i>what a surprise</i> that is.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> It’s safe to say that this Royal Commission has shown the obvious; <b>banks are stingy</b>, common decency doesn’t apply to those in the banking sector, and <b>don’t blindly trust anyone with your money</b>.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>So you’re probably better off taking all of your money out of your accounts, putting it in a jar, and <b>burying it in your backyard</b>. Or something like that. Maybe sh*t on top of it for good luck.

          Summary: Australia is about to introduce new laws that will change how political donations work and our foreign relationships
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> The government and Labour party have worked together to push new laws to prevent espionage. As both major parties are working on it, it is <b>likely to go pass</b>. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> By the way, when <b>opposing sides agree in Parliament</b>, it is called <i>bipartisan</i>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>This is a big change so let’s break this down into two main points, the <b>effects on foreign donations</b> and the <b>effect on individuals</b>.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>But first, some definitions.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Espionage: The practice of spying or of using spies, to obtain political and military information
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>First on the agenda, these new laws are aiming to <b>completely ban foreign donations for politics</b>. This covers everything from donations to major parties to donations to politically focussed charities.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Turnbull hopes that this will help reduce espionage and collusion with foreign powers.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> If you have ever seen an Asian hypebeast, you probably know that people in some <i>unnamed countries</i> in Asia have lots of money.</p>
        <div class="specialImg left">
          <img src="https://dylan-turner.github.io/AlexsWebsite/articles/images/oldWoman.png" alt="Kids...">
          Photo: Expired Asian hypebeast. From <a href="https://www.buzzfeed.com/kassycho/instagram-grandma-moon-lin%20"> here</a>
        </div>
        <p>And, if people can spend thousands on Supreme t-shirts and Bape hoodies, they can probably influence politicians through <del>bribes</del> donations, so this new law is a positive move towards change.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> Secondly, the law is to introduce <b>broader definitions for espionage</b>, as well as a <b>new program</b> for people who are not Australian citizens.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          The definition of the criminal offence of espionage will be changed to include <b>any possession of confidential documents</b>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> And also, if the laws goes through, Australia will implement a system where all foreign citizens in Australia who have links with other foreign powers must register themselves on a list.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="specialImg right">
          <img src="https://i.annihil.us/u/prod/marvel/i/mg/c/80/58d185fdaed22/background.jpg" alt="Kids...">
          Photo: The mutants were put on lists too. :( From <a href="https://i.annihil.us/u/prod/marvel/i/mg/c/80/58d185fdaed22/background.jpg">here</a>.
        </div>
        <p>If you’ve ever seen X-Men, this kind of sounds like that mutant register that the humans use to oppress all of the mutants. Just an observation.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>People have already said that the broader definitions for espionage may affect journalists who are <b>working to expose shady business in the government </b> as well as <b>potential whistleblowers</b> (people like Edward Snowden and Julian Assange).
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Also, can’t foreign donors just set up some company in Australia and donate through these <i>legitimate</i> Australian companies?
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>And what about all those <b>political charities</b> like <i>Amnesty International</i> who enforce global law with funds from all over the world?
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Isn’t this entire policy just giving <b>more power to the government and restricting the media</b> from doing its job?
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Where is the opposition to this?
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Catch us next week when we discuss authoritarianism in the Australian government then <b>get arrested</b>.

            <h3 class="title is-4">Laws to stop harassing women entering abortion clinics (and implement common sense)</h3>
          </div>
        </div>
        <p>
          On Thursday, after a few hours of discussion, the NSW government passed a law to stop the harassing of women that enter abortion clinics, and joins the ACT, Victoria, Tasmania and the Northern Territory in similar regulations.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> The law essentially establishes an area of 150 meters around abortion clinics for safe zones and even threatens with potential jail time if people are still found doing this.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>During the discussions on Thursday night, there were two definite opposite sides. Nationals and Labor MPs discussed the law, with Labor MP Leslie Williams saying that it was “not about abortions” but “respecting the rights of others.”
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          <i>Huh?</i>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> Dominic Perrottet, the NSW treasurer and devout Catholic, said that the National party should “know better” than to support the ruling. Basically, he’s saying that there is value in life, which is removed though this bill. What did you expect?
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Several more opinions were voiced throughout the debate, and you can find them all <a href="https://www.smh.com.au/politics/nsw/abortion-clinic-safe-access-zones-become-law-in-nsw-20180607-p4zk18.html">here</a>, on the Sydney Morning Herald website.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> At the end of the day, the NSW government went in favor of this law.
