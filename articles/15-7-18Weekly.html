        <br>
        <p>Summary: Over the last week, some of Australia and New Zealand’s politically engaged youth convened to debate and discuss political ideas in Adelaide for the UN Youth National Conference. </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>From the 5th of July to the 11th of July, over 100 politically engaged students attended the annual UN Youth National Conference in Adelaide.</p>

<br>
<br>
<p>Each Australian state, territory and New Zealand sends a delegation of both school students as well as a few university students, whom function as ‘staff’ or facilitators. The term ‘staff’ here is used loosely because the facilitators seemed to have <i>just as much fun as the delegates</i>.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>The ACT sent 8 students and 3 facilitators (the smallest delegation ☹), including <i>The Uninformed Reader’s</i> very own Alexander Wang. </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>We wonder what shady methods he employed to get into the delegation.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Each day delegates awoke to <b> very loud </b> drums and a packed schedule - full of political discussions, workshops, guest speakers (<b>who weren’t always that helpful</b>) and Model United Nation (<i>MUN</i>) debates. A <i>MUN</i> is essentially a roleplay of an UN Assembly, so each delegate represents a specific country and a resolution is debated.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>The National Conference and UN Youth in general is designed to prepare the youth to tackle large issues in our society, and all members of the organization are younger than 25.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>As one of the guest speakers puts it, “No pressure, but you guys need to single-handedly solve all the problems that us baby-boomers leave to you before they destroy the world”. <i>Yeah, thanks for the encouragement</i>!</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>I had a great time talking to other politically engaged youth and I know hope they had a great time talking to me too.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Shout out to all the delegates that I <i>bullied</i> into subscribing to The Uniformed Reader! Please share it with your friends and family (<i>shameless plug is shameless</i>).

            <h3 class="title is-4">Trump has Landed</h3>
          </div>

        <p>Summary: Trump does what Trump does.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
This week the President of the United States has made his first official visit to Great Britain this week and it has gone <b><i>wonderfully</i></b>. </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Wonderful that is for the rest of the world.
 </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
As usual, Trump has made several large and, controversial statements. The most notable of which include; the almost customary “immigrants are flooding the nation” statement as well as some stark criticism of the way Theresa May handled Brexit. He has also called for Boris Johnson to be the next PM.
 </p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
As a natural result of these remarks, Trump has been subject to the complaints of the British people.
 
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
Following the stereotypical British mindset of “complain about everything”, numerous protests have followed Trump’s visit. But by far the comical form of protest so far has been the inflatable <i>Baby Trump</i> air balloon that took to the streets of London shortly after he arrived.
 </p>

<br>
<br>
<p>
On the other hand, the politics of Trump’s visit have been <b>vague and uneventful</b>, similar to most of his diplomatic visits.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p> 
When in talks with British PM, Theresa May, he is reported to have said that Brexit could put a US-Britain trade deal at risk but then quickly retracted this.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p> 
Trump’s visits to Europe have all had a similar tone and theme, <b>say outrageous statements and create a mess then don’t actually do anything</b>.</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
 As has already been said by many before, Trump is a <i>reality TV star</i>, not a diplomat or politician.</p>
