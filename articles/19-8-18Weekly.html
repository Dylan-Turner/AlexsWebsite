            </h3>
          </div>

        <h3 class="subtitle">By: Alexander W</h3>
        <br>
        <p> Summary: The National Energy Guarantee (NEG) is causing schisms within the Government.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Following the draft of the NEG last week, a few Coalition MP’s have stated that they are willing to <b>cross the floor to vote against the policy</b>. These include; George Christensen, Andrew Hastie, Kevin Andrews and Andrew Gee.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          And of course, everyone’s favourite semi-relevant, lurking ex-Prime Minister <i>Tony Abbott</i>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          The concerns are mostly to do with the <b>NEG’s focus on cutting carbon emissions</b> rather than cutting costs.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          The NEG is already teetering on the brink of failure, and this new development may be enough to push it into failure, unless Turnbull can somehow convince Labor to vote to pass the bill.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>

          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          Disappointingly, PM Turnbull has decided to <b>scrap the 26% emission cuts from the NEG</b> to appease the Coalition’s back benchers. Once again, global warming is being ignored. Cheers Turnbull!
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          To make matters worse, there are new rumours of Peter Dutton taking over Prime Ministership from Turnbull, however, these were quickly dispelled by Christopher Pyne.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          A controversial plan to cut carbon emissions, a vengeful ex-Prime Minister, a lack of party support for the PM, <i>sounds familiar</i>, doesn't it?

          Summary: Australia's biggest supermarket retailer’s IT system somehow fails on a Sunday morning.

        <br>
        <p>
          On Sunday morning, Coles <b>stores around the country were shut</b>, with notices such as the one on the left on their doors.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Most of the notices said that <b>“network errors” or a “nationwide computer problem” was to blame</b>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          You might think that this sort of thing doesn’t happen very often and was just a once off, but you would be wrong.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Back in April, <b>Woolworths had a similar glitch</b> at 4pm in the afternoon, and some <b>customers had to abandon their shopping in the aisles</b> of supermarkets.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>Not all stores were hit by this glitch</b>, one store in Canberra even had only one checkout open.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          I’m sure after this glitch and and the plastic bag ban situation, Coles customer satisfaction ratings won’t be looking too good.

            <h3 class="title is-4">Fraser Anning's "final solution"</h3>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h3 class="subtitle">By: Alexander W</h3>
        <p> Summary: Ex-One Nation party senator Fraser Anning has given a highly controversial speech in the Senate about whether Australia should accept migrants.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Last week, in his maiden speech after joining the Katter’s Australia party Fraser Anning discussed <b>whether Australia should be taking non-English speaking or Muslim migrants</b>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          In his speech, Senator Anning outlined the supposedly factual reasons for not accepting any more Muslims into the country.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          He noted:
        </p>
        <ul>
          <li style="list-style-type:disc !important;">The high rates of crime in the Muslim populace
          </li>
          <li style="list-style-type:circle !important;margin-left:15px;">(“Muslims in New South Wales and Victoria are three times more likely than other groups to be convicted of crimes”)
          </li>
          <li style="list-style-type:disc !important;">The welfare dependency of many Muslims </li>
          <li style="list-style-type:circle !important;margin-left:15px;">(“The majority of Muslims in Australia of working age do not work and exist on welfare”, he later elaborated upon this as 56%)
          </li>
          <li style="list-style-type:disc !important;">The rise of Muslim terrorism </li>
          <li style="list-style-type:circle !important;margin-left:15px;">(“while all Muslims are not terrorists, certainly all terrorists these days are Muslims”)
          </li>
        </ul>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Though, many of these claims have been <b>fact checked and found to be inaccurate to an extent</b>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          The Australian Bureau of Statistics does not release statistics on the religion of criminals so the claim that Muslims are three times more likely to commit crimes <b>cannot be proved</b>. Also, the number of Muslims at working age on welfare was found to be <b>43% rather than 56%</b> but the point still somewhat stands.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          The first reactions to this speech is those of condemnation. <b>PM Turnbull called the speech “racist”</b> and many other MP’s have expressed their disappointment with the speech. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="specialImg left">
          <a href="#">
            <img src="https://i.kym-cdn.com/entries/icons/mobile/000/023/397/C-658VsXoAo3ovC.jpg" alt="Kids..."></a>

            </small>
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
          <b>Even Pauline Hanson</b>, called his speech “straight from Goebbels’ handbook from Nazi Germany” due to Anning using the infamous phrase “the final solution”.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Imagine that… Being so racist that even other racists call you out.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          With all this being said, it becomes extremely easy to discount what Anning is saying. His speech is <b>undoubtedly racist and provocative</b>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          However, it’s important we don’t rule out these opinions because quite often it is these discussions that facilitate discussion by making headlines.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          At the end of the day, though highly controversial, Anning has brought more content to the table, which could lead to a more productive Australia and a better society for all people. </p>
