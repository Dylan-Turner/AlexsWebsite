			    <h1 class="title headline">Australian Budget 2018</h1>
			    <h1 class="subtitle ">It should be short and sweet with a subtitle</h1>
			    <br/>
			    <p>TL; DR
				<br/>
			    </p>
			    <br/>
			    <p> Every year, the treasurer of Australia stands up in the parliament, and talks about how Australia will spend its money over the next year. After 117 years of doing the budget, you would think that the government would be pretty good at this thing, right?
			    	<br/><br/>
				Right?
					<br/><br/>
				Scott Morrison, the current treasurer, announced his budget for the upcoming year on Tuesday, the 8th of May and boy oh boy was there a lot inside it.
					<br/><br/>
				For our coverage on the budget, scroll down. For more information, check out this ABC Winners and Losers page.

			  <br/>
			  <p>Okay onto our coverage.<br/>
			  	<strong>Before you do anything</strong>, though, give yourself a <strong>firm and encouraging</strong> pat on the back. Getting involved in politics means you are on your way to becoming an informed reader.
			  </p>
			  <br/><br/>
			  <h3 class="title is-4">What is the Budget?</h3>
			  <p> 
			  	Geez, I really hope you aren’t wondering that. <br/><br/>
			  	Whatever, no judgement here, everyone’s gotta start somewhere!<br/><br/>

			  	In a sentence, the Budget is a document that predicts how much the government will be spending and how much the government will be earning for the next financial year. <br/><br/>
			  	The government uses the Budget to attract more voters by offering things like tax cuts or road upgrades.
			  	<br/><br/>
			  	By the way, financial years aren’t the same as the normal calendar, which is why you have end of financial year sales in June.


			  </p>
			  <br/><br/>
			  <h3 class="title is-4">Road Projects for the ACT</h3>
			  <p> 
			  	TL;DR TL:DR Monaro highway and Barton highway are getting wider<br/><br/>
			  	Whatever, no judgement here, everyone’s gotta start somewhere!<br/><br/>

			  	<img class="articleImg" src="https://cdn-images-1.medium.com/max/1600/1*j3IGXiLI8vsHfR0C0aDcyg@2x.png"/>

			  	$100 million is going towards widening the Monaro and Barton highways and also to add a ‘flyover’ for the intersection between Lanyon drive and Monaro Highway.<br/><br/>

			  	If you know where this intersection is, congrats on your future bridge thingo. If not, it probably doesn't matter for you anyway.

			  </p>

			<br/>
			  <br/>

			  <h3 class="title is-4">Personal tax cuts</h3>
			  <h3 class="subtitle is-4">You can then have a image below</h3>
			  
			  <p> 
			  	TL:DR Depending on how much you (or more likely your parents) earn, you could be paying up to $530 less in taxes this year.<br/><br/>
			  	Ok this is the big one.<br/><br/>
			  	
			  	If you look at the table to the side, which I definitely did not take from the ABC (just in case I get sued, I did take it), you can see how much tax will be reduced for a specific income.<br/><br/>

			  	The government plans to increase the tax cuts in future, especially for higher income citizens, but let's not talk about that because government's change leaders like every 2 years now and also Labor might come in and just scrap all of it. <br/><br/>

				Anyway, this is a clear move to get low and middle income earners on their side, as they are getting the most cuts. However, other than people earning below $20,001 (who don’t get taxed), everyone gets at least some tax cuts.
				<br/><br/>

				Hooray, free money.  <br/><br/>

				Kinda.<br/><br/>

				Labor, the opposition, have said that they will almost double the government’s tax cut, if elected. For example, if you were earning 60,000 under Labor, you would have a $928 tax cut, rather than $530.<br/><br/>

				If this sounds too good to be true, it probably is. All political parties do this, the old bait and switch. <br/><br/>

				Scammers also do this.<br/><br/>
