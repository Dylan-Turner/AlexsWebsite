        <p> Summary: Even after the recent leadership spill, we still look great when being compared to the USA.
        </p>
        <br>

        <p>
          Slow news week... Let’s fly away from Australia and fly into <s>dystopia</s> the United States of America.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          So what’s going on in the USA? Well for starters, the Government is being run by a guy who is <b>straight out of a reality TV-show</b>, his team is under investigation for <b>suspected collusion</b> and over <b>34% of his staff have exited</b>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>In short, Trump’s happening.</b>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Last week, Trump was in the headlines for coming under fire, <i>again</i>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>But Alex</b>, I hear you saying, this isn’t news! This happens every week!
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Yes, readers, it's true that Trump gets roasted by someone every other week. But this time is different! The criticism came from the one and only, <b>former President Barack Obama.</b>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          You know it’s bad when the person <b>you replaced</b> is saying that the Government is lacking in “honesty and decency and lawfulness”.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Obama talked about the <b>recent instability in the country</b> and admitted that Trump is only “a symptom, not the cause”, pointing to the <b>growing resentment of politicians</b>. Obama also spoke out against Trump <b>pressuring the justice department</b>, specifically Trump’s calls to protect members of his party from persecution.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          So how would a normal politician react to this? “Well, gee, thanks for the feedback, Obama, I’ll think about it” or something, right? <i>Right</i>??

        <br>
        <p>
          Ah, the irony of Australia and USA.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          We have <b>too many leaders</b>...

        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Maybe we can send one of our ex-Prime Ministers to the USA to take over.

        <p>Summary: Scott Morrison makes announces a major policy change on breakfast television which the opposition government has been pushing for years.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Australia has an “Age Pension”, which is designed to provide a form of income to old people when they are unable to work. To qualify for the aged pension, among other things, you need to be of a certain age.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>When the pension was introduced in 1910, the pension age was 65, and life expectancy was around 58</b>. That is, most people would actually die before being old enough to receive a pension. As a result, only 100,000 people were receiving it.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Fast forward to today, and our life expectancy is 82 years. As a result, <b>there are 2.2 million people on the pension.</b>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Recently, there has been a lot of change regarding the pension age. Here’s a quick summary:
        </p>
        <br>
        <ul>
          <li style="list-style-type:disc !important;">In 2009, the Rudd government announced it would increase the pension age from 65 to 67 from 2017-2023 (six months every 2 years).
          </li>
          <li style="list-style-type:disc !important;">In 2014, under the Abbott government, Treasurer Joe Hockey announced the pension age would continue increasing up to 70 years old.
          </li>
          <li style="list-style-type:disc !important;">Labour has been campaigning against this change ever since.
          </li>
          <li style="list-style-type:disc !important;">Last Wednesday, Morrison announced it would stay at 67 in 2023, not increasing to 70.  </li>
          <li style="list-style-type:disc !important;">The pension age is currently <b>65 years and six months.</b>
            <ul>
              <li>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                  The issues surrounding this are complex. While the pension age should theoretically increase in order to compensate for increasing life expectancies (keeping people in the labour force for longer), people simply don’t want to work until they are 70 years old, especially those in <b>physically demanding jobs</b> — 70 year-olds don’t mix well with lifting heavy things for some reason.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                  The issue itself aside, an important question is, “Why now?” Scott Morrison has been the treasurer for years and hasn’t changed this. To us, This seems like a populist move from a desperate government. As Bill Shorten put it, Morrison seems to be “temporarily borrowing Labour policy”.
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                  So much for <i>shifting the liberal party further to the right.</i>
                </p>
                <br>
                <br>
                <p>
                  And, um, why did he have to announce it on the <i>Today Show</i>?
