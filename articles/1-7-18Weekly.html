            <h3 class="title is-4">Company Tax Cuts has the Labor party cut-up</h3>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h3 class="subtitle">By: Alexander W</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Summary: Bill Shorten and the Labor party have backtracked on their promise to completely oppose the Company Tax Cut Bill.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Earlier this week, Shorten and the Labor party seemed <b>very determined</b> to repeal Company Tax Cuts. He claimed that tax cuts for medium sized businesses ($10 million - $50 million turnover) would be repealed if elected as Government.</p>
        <br>
        <br>

        </div>
        <p>Well, turns out that Shorten has a <b>big mouth</b>. The Labor party actually <i>don’t</i> want to repeal that Tax Cut.</p>

        <br>
        <br>
        <p>On Thursday, Shorten, this time with his fellow ministers watching over him <i><b>very closely</b></i>, stated that there was some there was a mix-up within the party’s policy and the Labor party will keep the Tax Cuts. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Hmmmm... Seems suspicious to me.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Shorten claimed that this mistake was due to <b>“confusion”</b> and <b>“uncertainty”</b> within the party. </p>
        <div class="specialImg right">

        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>The only thing <i>“confusing”</i> about this situation is the complete lack of communication and coordination in the Labor party room. How could they let a mistake this big happen? And the only thing “uncertain” about this situation is Labor’s chance at winning the election after this major screw-up. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>This situation has led to one of the greatest political roasts we’ve seen for a while.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>PM Malcolm Turnbull called the situation </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p><b>“completely and utterly humiliating”</b></p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>And he criticised Shorten by saying that Shorten:</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p><b>"He can't keep the same policy position for a week"</b></p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>In our opinion, this criticism is completely fair. Communication and diplomacy are <b>basic skills</b> that all politicians should be practicing. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>And this week’s incident just goes to show the <i>lack</i> of both of these skills within the Labor party room and with their leader.</p>

            <h3 class="title is-4">Penalty Rate Cuts</h3>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h3 class="subtitle">By: Gautam M</h3>
        <p>Summary: Government introduces new penalty rate cuts to fund the <i>great</i> tax cuts brought by the budget.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>From the 1st of July 2018 the Australian government will be <b>cutting penalty rates</b> for workers (the extra pay that you get for working overtime or on holidays and stuff like that) in certain industries. Those being the hospitality, fast-food, pharmacy and retail industries.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="specialImg left">

            <img src="https://dylan-turner.github.io/AlexsWebsite/penaltyRates.png" alt="Kids..."></a>
          Figure: Reduced penalty rates don’t look good. Source from <a href="http://www.abc.net.au/news/2018-06-29/sunday-penalty-rate-changes-take-effect-this-weekend/9924344?section=politics">here.</a>
        </div>
        <p>You know what the funny thing is though? Politicians get to enjoy a pay rise of 2% from Sunday, basically giving someone like Turnbull an extra <b>$10,500 a year </b>. That makes him earn just over <b>$538,000 a year</b>. <i class="em em-thinking_face"></i>.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>The aim behind the changes is to help fund the tax cuts mentioned at this year’s budget.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>On the other hand, as directed by a Fair Work Commission Ruling about a month ago, the minimum work wage will go up 3.5% as of the 1st of July, to $18.93 an hour.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Bill Shorten talked about the reduction of penalty rates over his time at the NSW Labor Party conference, and basically said that he will <b>restore the original penalty rates</b> if he’s voted in. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p> Although, given his backflip on the Company tax cuts, we aren’t so sure that he will stick to his word.</p>

            <h3 class="title is-4">National Redress Scheme</h3>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h3 class="subtitle">By: Alexander W</h3>
        <p>
          Summary: The Government has accepted a recommendation from the Royal Commission into Child Sexual Abuse to roll out a National Redress Scheme.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>For context, over the past few years, a Royal Commission was established to investigate cases of Child Sexual Abuse in national institutions. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>A few weeks ago, the Government accepted <b>104 of the Commission’s 122 recommendations</b>, including a National Redress (admitting fault and compensating) Scheme.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>This Sunday, the National Redress Scheme will roll out, which essentially allows victims of sexual abuse who were in National Institutes to receive up to a maximum of $150,000 in compensation, although the <i>average</i> payment will be around $76,000.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>While there are some flaws in this system, overall it is a positive step. This scheme <b>acknowledges the harms that were done</b> to these people and that they deserve an apology. Furthermore, it gives victims compensation without forcing them to go to court.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>The main piece of criticism that has been raised is to do with how the Government will determine payment amounts. Given that for many people this is a sensitive matter, how will the Government determine how much each case is <i>“worth”</i>?</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>This could lead to really awkward situations where the government finds that someone’s case isn’t worth anything or perhaps very little.</p>
