            <h3 class="title is-4">When will our next election be? ‚Äî Analysis</h3>

        <h3 class="subtitle">By: Zack Noyes</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Summary: The new government has to call a federal election before 18th May. In this analysis, we take you through the factors the government might be looking at, and when our next election is likely to be.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Every three years, the government has two elections, one for the senate (lower house) and one for the house of representatives (upper house). To make things easier, the government tries to hold these elections on the same day. Since the senate election <b>cannot be later than 18th May</b>, this will probably also be the latest possible date for the house of representatives election.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Additionally, Scott Morrison has suggested that <b>he does not want to call an election this year</b>, and why would he? The Liberals need <i>some time</i> to at least <i>attempt</i> to recover from, let‚Äôs just say, recent events. So, let‚Äôs work on the basis that we‚Äôll have a 2019 election.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>January and February can be pretty much ruled out</b>. An election at these times would mean the government would have to campaign in the summer holidays when people are likely switched off from the media.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          NSW also has a <i>state election</i> being held on the 23rd of March. This can <i>technically</i> be moved, but this creates costs for the Australian Electoral Commission. This means that <b>a federal election is unlikely to be held in the second half of March or the first half of April.</b>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>The easter weekend also takes the second half of April and the beginning of May out of the picture</b>. 
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>This leaves us with either the beginning of March or the middle of May.</b> However, if the election was held in May, the budget would need to be brought back to March or postponed. This isn‚Äôt a huge problem, but nevertheless something the government would have to consider.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          <b>Our guess? The 2nd or 9th of March</b>. After the summer holidays, but before the NSW state election.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Ok, if any of you bet money on this date and end up winning money, remember us. And also send some <s>money</s> love</p>

        <p>Summary: The newly retired Malcolm Turnbull is causing even more trouble for the Coalition by lobbying for Peter Dutton to be referred to the High Court to check his eligibility to sit in Parliament.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="specialImg right">
          <a href="#">
            <img src="https://d210i8t551lxm.cloudfront.net/images/contents/000/001/023/original/1445235861900.jpg?1504864540" alt="Kids..."></a>

            <small>Photo: Turnbull showing his evil genius side. <a href="https://d210i8t551lxm.cloudfront.net/images/contents/000/001/023/original/1445235861900.jpg?1504864540">Source</a>
            </small>
          </p>
        </div>
        <p> 
          It seems like Turnbull has now initiated his <b>master revenge plan</b>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Through a few tweets, last week Turnbull has called for Dutton to be <b>checked for his eligibility to sit in Parliament</b> under section 44(v) of the Constitution.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          These tweets have caused some controversy, with Dutton suggesting Turnbull should just <i>‚Äúenjoy his retirement‚Äù</i> and Barnaby Joyce saying that Turnbull ‚Äúhas an active campaign to try and remove [the Coalition] as the Government‚Äù ‚Äì not that taking down the Coalition takes much at this point.
          </p>
          <br>
          <br>
        <p>
          Essentially, Dutton may be ineligible because he is the a<b>beneficiary of a trust which owns two childcare centres in Queensland</b>. Childcare centres receive subsidies from the Government for providing childcare services.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Therefore, Dutton could have <b>ulterior motives for enacting policies</b>, meaning he shouldn‚Äôt be eligible for Parliament.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Dutton says that he had ‚Äúnever taken a dollar of distribution from that enterprise‚Äù and that the childcare centres are his ‚Äúwife‚Äôs business‚Äù.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
    <div class="specialImg left">

            <small>Photo: Hmmmm... <a href="http://thesauce.co/wp-content/uploads/2016/03/turnt.jpg">Source</a>
            </small>
          </p>
        </div>
        <p>
         ü§î 
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Is Dutton saying that he and his wife have <b>separate bank accounts</b>, his wife has <i>never</i> given him any money, and he has <b>NOTHING to gain</b> from helping his wife‚Äôs business?
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Either Dutton has an <b>extremely</b> problematic relationship with his wife, or he‚Äôs spouting garbage.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Prime Minister Scott Morrison said that the issue is <b>‚Äúnot something [he is] terribly distracted by‚Äù</b> but said he would make some inquiries. However, many Constitutional experts think there is a case for Peter Dutton‚Äôs parliamentary ineligibility.
