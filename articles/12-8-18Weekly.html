        <p> Summary: In an attempt to show support for action to save the Great Barrier Reef, the Government has donated $444 million to the Great Barrier Reef Foundation, a non-profit organisation with six staff members.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Two weeks ago, in what can only be called <i>bizarre</i>, the Government has donated copious amounts of money to a small organisation dedicated to protecting the GBR.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          To put this into perspective, this organisation is <b>even smaller</b> than <i>The Uninformed Reader</i>!
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Where’s our funding?
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          As expected, this small organisation has been <b>overwhelmed by this huge funding boost</b>. Last week, Michael Myers, a notable financial backer and ex-board member of the organisation, said in an interview with the ABC that the funding was:
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          <i>“quite shocking and almost mind-blowing”</i>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          The organisation did not request funding from the Government and critics don’t believe this funding will be especially productive.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          It seems as if PM Turnbull and the Government simply wanted to make headlines for supporting this organisation and the movement to save the reef.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Don’t get us wrong, though! This is a positive step. It’s just that this new funding seems to have some <i>not-so-subtle</i> ulterior motives.
        </p>

        <p>Summary: Pauline Hanson has called for foreign aid to be redirected to help Australian farmers suffering from the drought.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Last week, Pauline Hanson posted this on twitter:
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div>
          <a href="#">
            <img src="https://i.imgur.com/BxMFJRW.png" alt="Kids..."></a>
        </div>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>There is so much wrong with this. First of all, there is the question of whether or not redirecting foreign aid would actually do anything. Before you read any further, what percentage of our budget do you think we spend on aid? How much should we spend?
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>We spend 0.8% of our federal budget on foreign aid.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>So really, our foreign aid has almost all disappeared anyway, <b>should we really redirect the little amount we have left?</b>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p><b>There are so many other parts of the budget that we could take this money from</b>, take for example Turnbull’s <i>surprise $444 million dollar donation to the great barrier reef (previous article)</i>. The only reason Hanson has picked Foreign Aid is that it grabs people’s attention.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Also, <b>foreign aid actually helps farmers</b>. By establishing good relationships through foreign aid, Australia develops key agricultural trading partners.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Don’t take this the wrong way, we need to help our farmers. <b>
          <i>Just leave the foreign aid budget alone.</i></b>
        </p>

            <h3 class="title is-4">Carbon Emission Cuts? That’s A NEGative</h3>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h3 class="subtitle">By: Alexander W</h3>
        <p> Summary: The National Energy Guarantee (NEG) was recently drafted and states are expressing conditional support.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          The NEG is an energy policy that will ensure that Australians get cheaper and more reliable electricity and cut carbon emissions by 26% in 2030 by pushing energy companies to use a more diverse range of energy production methods, such as renewables and gas.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          According to most experts and analysts, average annual energy prices can be expected to fall by around <b>$100-$120 per household</b>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          The main concern that states and Labor have with the NEG is the carbon emission reduction goals. The NEG aims to reduce emissions in 2030 by 26%, which was agreed upon in the Paris Agreement.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          However, Australia will probably reduce emissions by 24% anyway, <b>even without the NEG</b>, so functionally, the NEG will only reduce emissions by a measly 2%.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          States want this to be higher. Labor has also voiced these concerns and is going to draft their own version of the NEG with higher emission reduction goals.
        </p>
