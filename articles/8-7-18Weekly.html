            <h3 class="title is-4">Basketbrawl: Australia vs the Philippines</h3>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h3 class="subtitle">By: Alexander W</h3>
        <br>
        <p>Summary: 2 weeks ago, one of the “most hostile and violent” brawls in basketball history occurred during a FIBA World Cup qualifying match between Australia and the Philippines hosted in the Philippines.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
The incident erupted in the third quarter of the game after Phillippines player Roger Ray Pogoy shoved Australian player Chris Goulding to the ground. This in turn led nearby Australian player Daniel Kickert to retaliate and elbow Pogoy in the face.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
After that, all hell broke loose. 
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
The Philippine’s bench rushed out onto the court and started attacking the Australian players. As well as this, many Philippines fans, coaches and even supposedly security guards started having a go at the Aussies.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
However, the Aussies fought back as well, with Thon Maker, a young center from the Milwaukee Bucks NBA team, delivering some now iconic <b>“flying kicks”</b>, which were largely ineffective.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
Most horrifyingly, one Australian player, Chris Goulding, was isolated and beaten by a crowd of Filipino players, officials and fans. According to Goulding’s agent; if Australia’s assistant coach, Luc Longley, hadn’t rushed in to break up the Filipino mob, Goulding’s life could’ve been at risk. 
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
At this point, we don’t even know what is going on.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
An Aussie even had a <i>chair</i> thrown at him towards the end of the fight.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
This entire incident has been a shame on international basketball and unfortunately, most likely a shame that will hang on the Philippines due to the brutal depiction of them in the fight. 
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
Every part of the fight was videotaped and people are <b>still discovering offences</b>, such as a Filipino coach punching and Australian player while he was <b>restrained by a security guard</b>.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
After the brawl, 4 Australian players were ejected and 9 FIlipino players were ejected, eventually leading to an Aussie win by default after the remaining three Filipino players fouled out. However, the conduct of the Philippines team was <b>simply disgusting</b>. Filipino players were <b>smiling and grinning</b> after the incident and even had the audacity to take a <b><i>group selfie</i></b> with smiles and gang poses.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
The entire incident has been blamed on many things. While it is obvious that Kickert’s elbow on the Filipino’s player was uncalled for and quite cheap, the Filipino team’s reaction and ensuing brawl was simply disgusting conduct. 
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
The Filipino coach has pinned the incident on the Australian team’s attitude before the game, where Krickert had apparently pushed a Filipino player who had tried to trip him.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
Luc Longley blamed the Filipino coach for having a lack of control over his players and encouraging violence in a previous timeout, which was also on recording.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
FIBA has yet to come out with official punishments for players involved but they have said that there will be repercussions.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
In terms of politics, this incident will leave a dent in the relationship between the Philippines and Australia.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
*UPDATE* FIBA is still investigating and have yet to come out with specific punishments but heavy sanctions are expected.
</p>

            <h3 class="title is-4">Energy Concerns</h3>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h3 class="subtitle">By: Zack N</h3>
        <p>Summary: Abbott is urging Australia to pull out of the Paris Climate Agreement, a deal which he agreed to back when he was prime minister.

</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
The main problem behind this frankly quite bold statement is to do with a government energy policy that Turnbull brought in last year — The National Energy Guarantee (NEG).
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>Basically, this policy supposedly aims to achieve three things:
</p>
<br/>
<ul>
    
    <li style="list-style-type: disc !important;" >Lower energy prices</li>
    <li style="list-style-type: disc !important;" >Maintain consistent energy supply</li>
    <li style="list-style-type: disc !important;" ><b>Reduce emissions to the levels required by the Paris Climate Agreement</b></li>
    
</ul>
<br/>
<br/>
<p>
That last one is important. Abbott’s argument is that the national energy guarantee doesn’t pay enough attention to the first two parts, and is sacrificing the stability and affordability of Australian energy in order to reduce emissions. Abbott wants to abolish the NEG and leave the climate agreement as he thinks it is not worth it for us.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
Abbott is so sure about this that he says he would be willing to cross the floor in parliament to go against the NEG. (Crossing the floor is when a politician votes against his own party)
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
He’s not alone either, plenty of Nationals members are also against the NEG, they argue that it needs to have incentives for reliable ‘baseload’ energy systems like coal power plants.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
Now, Abbott is right in that <i>times have changed</i>. When he agreed to this deal, he thought that we would be able to manage the environmental responsibilities but still provide economical energy. Additionally, Donald Trump pulling out of the agreement has severely weakened it, the US being one of the largest emitters of fossil fuels.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
But, in our opinion, this doesn’t mean we should follow. Just because we don’t emit much compared to other countries, it doesn’t mean that we can just change our mind about things we have <b>agreed to</b>. His is the argument that politicians such as <b>foreign minister Julie Bishop</b> are taking.
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
When Abbott agreed to the Paris Climate Agreement, he said, “The difference between Australia and a lot of other countries, quite frankly is, <i>when we make commitments to reduce emissions we keep them</i>”. We bet he regrets saying that now...
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
Right now, the climate change issue on a global scale is about <b>attitude</b>, in terms of per capita carbon emissions, Australia is one of the highest. <i>How can we expect other countries to reduce emissions when we don't</i>?
</p>
<br>
<br>
<p>
Times are changing, and we are going to need to make hard calls between reducing emissions and protecting ourselves. This is one of them.
</p>
