        <p>Summary: Parliament wastes everybody’s time by discussing a slightly miscategorised Woolworths fake meat product.

        <p><i>This story makes us want to question the value of the Australian Parliament.</i>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>First, some background. The fake meat trend has become <i>increasingly popular</i> with many <b>plant-based or lab-grown meats</b> being introduced into major supermarkets.</b>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>This week, a particular fake meat sparked controversy because it was stocked by Woolworths in the <b>red meat section</b>. It was clearly labelled as a <b>‘100% plant-based’</b> mince product.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
       
        <p>Normally, it probably should be in a different area but for the most part, this new categorization was harmless.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Well, not according to members of the Coalition who made major beef out of a supposedly beefless product.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>National Party Senator Barry O’Sullivan said:
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p><b>“Woolworths need to pull it from the shelves today,”</b>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>A few other MP’s and Senators have called for tighter regulations for the definitions of "meat" and "mince" as well as better labelling for future fake meat products.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>An Australian Meat Industry Council representative also said that fake meat products are:
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p><b>“piggy-backing on the back of industries that have invested hundreds of millions, if not billions of dollars, to get their product identified for what it is,”</b>
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p><b>What?!</b> Billions of dollars have gone into getting meat <i>"identified"</i> as meat? Does that mean that without this <b>"hefty investment"</b>, an average consumer would think meat products are <i>fruits</i>?
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Woolworths has said that this is to be a <b>permanent change</b>, so this fake mince is most likely going to stay in the red meats area.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>In our opinion, this is <b>a big fuss over nothing</b> and likely only the first step in a major plan.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Recently, more and more research has gone into the effects of red meats on the body as well as the effect of farming animals in relation to global warming.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>It has been found that both processed red meats and unprocessed red meats <b>may cause cancer</b> and also, more importantly, <b>farming animals could be one of the leading factors behind global warming</b>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>This research has caused more people to become vegetarian or just consume less meat.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>This move by Woolworth’s is likely just a natural step in responding to consumer demand.
        </p>

            <h3 class="title is-4">Tax cuts pass! Hooray!</h3>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h3 class="subtitle">By: Alexander W</h3>
        <p>Summary: In a somewhat surprising development, the Government’s first two steps of a three-step tax cut plan passes through the Senate.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
        This year’s budget (which you can find more about <a href=”https://uninformedreader.com/articles/budgetSpecial.html”>here</a>) announced a major long-term tax cut bill for working Australians. This bill was passed into Senate for voting a few weeks ago, and up until this week, it looked like that bill was not going to pass.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
        This was because the <b>Centre Alliance party</b> and the <b>One Nation party</b> did not want to pass the bill.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <div class="specialImg right">
            <img src="https://dylan-turner.github.io/AlexsWebsite/statue.png" alt="Kids...">
          Photo: How we feel about the One Nation party at the moment. From <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/3/3b/Paris_Tuileries_Garden_Facepalm_statue.jpg/300px-Paris_Tuileries_Garden_Facepalm_statue.jpg">here.</a>
        </div>
        <p>
        Well, the Government made it happen, probably by doing a backroom deal with the One Nation party and the Centre Alliance party. </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
        The original 3 phase tax cut plan was split and the first two phases were passed, which likely means the entire plan will be passed.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
        So, most working citizens will be receiving a <b>tax cut</b>, which will increase over the next few years. The first two phases give major tax cuts to low-middle income earners, whereas the third phase cuts tax for higher earners.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
        The most surprising part of this is the One Nation party voting to pass the bill. This is because recently ex-One Nation party Senator Brian Burston had a <b><i>very </b></i>public feud with Pauline Hanson and One Nation because he wanted to vote to pass the bill but the party didn’t.</p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>

        That’s a major facepalm moment for Pauline Hanson and the One Nation party. </p>

            <h3 class="title is-4">Speeding through the Senate</h3>
          </div>
        </div>
        <h3 class="subtitle">By: Rafael Priest/h3>
        <p>
          Summary: Turnbull's company tax cuts bill will likely not be passing through Senate, at least not for the distant future.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
       
        <p>In the final seating week of Parliament before a break, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull and his trusty henchman of a treasurer, Scott Morrison, hope to pass their company tax cuts bill through the Senate.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>Although a slightly revised version of the government’s personal tax cuts was passed with relative ease, the company tax cuts will be a <b>far greater challenge</b> to pass through the Senate.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>“Though Turnbull successfully gained the votes of the One Nation party and the Centre Alliance party for their previous personal tax bill, it is <b>unlikely that they will be able to garner the support of Pauline Hanson</b> and One Nation again for this bill.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          Hanson has previously stated that she will <b>not support the company tax cuts</b> as it does not favour the people she represents.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
          In all honesty, the only bill that would favour her supporters is an increase in <i>Centrelink payments</i>.
        </p>
        <br>
        <br>
        <p>
         Without Hanson’s support and the Labor party’s steadfast opposition to the bill, Turnbull will face an uphill battle to pass it before the next election let alone pass it in the next week.
